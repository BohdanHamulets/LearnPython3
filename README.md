# 30 Days Of Python 3 

It was really interesting to learn Python in a practical manner, following 30 Days Of Python 3 Udemy course. 
Resolving real world tasks and using different API (including Twitter), send emails (using Gmail), send SMS/MMS (using Twilio), learn basic of web scraping (using Requsets&BeautifulSoup and Selenium), work with files (CSV, txt), and many more. Great stuff for the start! Got me really hyped to continue my learning path.

# Selenium

Continue learning automation, following "Selenium WebDriver With Python 3.x - Novice To Ninja" Udemy Course.

# The other content
Learning mess :) Which will be formatted later, after some results.
