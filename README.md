# 30 Days Of Python 3 

My first finnished cource of python3, feel free to check it out!

It was really interesting to learn working with different API (including Twitter), send emails (using gmail), send SMS/MMS (using twilio), learn basic of web scrapping (using requsets and Selenium), work with files (CSV, txt), and many more. Great stuff for the start! Got me really hyped to continue my learning path.
